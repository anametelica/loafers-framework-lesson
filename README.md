Web Design Course Assignment for The Coders Guild
Local Business Website Homepage

Objective:

As part of The Coders Guild's Web Design course, I created a website homepage for a local business needing a website upgrade. This assignment focuses on using the CSS framework Bootstrap to create a professional and responsive web design.

Loafers Vinyl & Coffee is a beloved local business, but their current Shopify template-based website makes it difficult to find information about them and understand what they offer.

Goals:

Gain hands-on experience with Bootstrap.
Develop a functional and aesthetic homepage that meets the needs of a local business.
Demonstrate the ability to implement responsive design principles.
This website homepage includes the use of the following Bootstrap elements:

Buttons
Navbar within a header section
Hero section
Features section with custom cards as potential links
Jumbotron
Footer with simple business name and copyright
Other skills used:

Inspect element to source original images within the current functioning Loafers website
File and name reorganization
Use of stock images and icons for aesthetic cohesion
Accessibility update by using contrasting colors as well as adding alt descriptors for images

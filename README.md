Web Design Course Assignment for The Coders Guild
Local Business Website Homepage

Objective:

As part of The Coders Guild's Web Design course, I created a website homepage for a local business needing a website upgrade. This assignment focuses on using the CSS framework Bootstrap to create a professional and responsive web design.

Loafers Vinyl & Coffee is a beloved local business, but their current Shopify template-based website makes it difficult to find information about them and understand what they offer.

Goals:

Gain hands-on experience with Bootstrap.
Develop a functional and aesthetic homepage that meets the needs of a local business.
Demonstrate the ability to implement responsive design principles.
This website homepage includes the use of the following Bootstrap elements:

Buttons
- navbar within a header section
- hero section
- features section with custom cards as potential links
- jumbotron
- footer with simple business name and copyright

Other skills used:

- inspect element to source original images within the current functioning Loafers website
- file and name reorganization
- use of stock images and icons for aesthetic cohesion
- accessibility update by using contrasting colors as well as adding alt descriptors for images
